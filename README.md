# Snail Mail

## Overview

Snail Mail is a video game written in C# using the Unity Engine.
It is designed for mobile devices, and currently is only for
Android devices.

## The Game

You are a snail mailman, who must collect scattered letters and deliver them
to the nearby home. This will involve many obstacles, but you need to deal
with them in order to finish your job and go back to your family.

There is one catch to this adventure, though: you can only move forward or
to the right! With letters all around you, you will need to find more creative
ways to travel around. Much of your experience will be avoiding harmful salt
while figuring out the path to various letters, so tread carefully.

## Distribution

The current plan is to put this game on the Google Play Store for Android devices,
but that is currently a work in progress. This text will be updated when the
game is posted there. In addition, this source code should be able to be built
via Unity. The main piece to note is that it was made with version 2019.1.14f1,
which may be required in order for the project to work correctly.

## Credits

This game was made entirely by Benjamin Massey.

However, many art sources were used, and they are credited in Assets/SOURCES.txt

In addition, all of these sources are listed in a credits page available
within the game itself via the "Credits" button in the bottom left of the
level select menu.

Thank you to every artist who created a wonderful asset that was needed to make
this game possible.
